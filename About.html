<h2>HYPE BEAST</h2>
<p>Hi! And welcome to Hype Beast.  My name is Hamza Hammad and Iâ€™m the creative director behind the blog. Urban Fashion, has always been a passion of mine that I have been mingling with for quite a while. My idea of a perfect outfit consists of simple and cost effective pieces of clothes blended together to make the perfect outfit. For years I have traveled the world and have seen how different people use similar clothes in new and innovative ways. My vision is simple; educate the masses about style, aesthetic and lifestyle.  
Join me in this adventure of fashion, art, and self-discovery.
