The Ripped Jeans Phenomena There used to be a time *not so long ago* where when a pair of jeans rips you either 1) Grab the closest pair of scissors and make distorted shorts out of them or 2) You throw the hell out of them. Nowadays, it has become a fashion statement. A fashion statement so pronounced that the bigger the rip, the more stylish you’re. I agree with that statement. I personally own 4 pairs of ripped jeans one for each mood. Due to a high demand, manufacturers are creating all types of rips. Here are some sample pictures.  If you don’t own ripped jeans, then you are missing out on an essential urban fashion piece. So pull your wallet out and start shopping.  Our experts recommend: H&M, Zara, Urban Outfitters, and Forever 21 to find the perfect pair.
